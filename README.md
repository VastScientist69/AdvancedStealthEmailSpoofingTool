Advanced Stealth Email Spoofing Tool
A sophisticated email spoofing proof-of-concept tool designed for educational purposes and authorized security testing. This tool demonstrates email authentication vulnerabilities while incorporating advanced evasion techniques.

⚠️ Disclaimer
This tool is for educational purposes and authorized security testing only. Unauthorized use of this software may violate local, state, and federal laws. Always obtain explicit written permission before testing any systems. The developers assume no liability for misuse of this tool.

Features
Automatic SMTP Discovery: Automatically finds and tests MX records for the spoofed domain

Stealth Headers: Adds legitimate-looking headers to bypass basic filters

Dual-Format Emails: Supports both plain text and HTML versions

Retry Mechanism: Implements exponential backoff for reliable delivery

Delay Options: Configurable delays to avoid pattern detection

Multiple Server Support: Includes common SMTP servers as fallbacks

TLS Support: Attempts encrypted connections when available

Defense Mechanisms
This tool demonstrates why organizations should implement:

SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)

Email filtering solutions with spoofing detection

Employee security awareness training

Limitations
Modern email providers have implemented strong protections against spoofing:

SPF/DKIM/DMARC policies often prevent successful delivery

Advanced AI-based filters detect suspicious patterns

Large providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) have robust spoofing protection

The effectiveness varies significantly between email providers

Ethical Use
This tool should only be used in:

Authorized penetration testing engagements

Educational environments with proper supervision

Research with explicit permission from all involved parties

Testing your own systems

Legal Considerations
Before using this tool, ensure you:

Have written authorization from the system owner

Understand applicable laws in your jurisdiction

Limit testing to systems you own or have permission to test

Document all activities for compliance purposes
